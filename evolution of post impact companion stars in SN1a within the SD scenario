TERMINOLOGY

hydrogen cataclysmic variables scenario: 


WHAT IS THE PAPER ABOUT?

simulated a SN1a for a bunch of stars to see if any of them are similar to Tycho G, a suspected companion star
of SN1572

WHAT DID THEY FIND OUT?

the closest model had the same effective temperature as tycho G and also managed to match its slow rotation speed
but the simulations luminosity and radius are twice as large

found that the stars expand post impact and continue to expand for about 1000 years before contracting

and that the evolution of the str depends on how much energy it absorbed and how deep the energy penetrated into the star


introduction notes:
they know there is a mass transfer phase for at least some of the SN1a explosions because there exists some 
pre-supernova circumstellar medium within the supernovae reminants

tycho G- high proper motion, low rotation speed <7.5km/s. SD scenario predicts high proper motion but you would
expect companion star to also have high rotational speed due to fast rotating orbits prior to explosion

But this is only the case when you dont consider how the star evolves post supernova
