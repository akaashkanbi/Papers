TERMINOLOGY

hydrogen cataclysmic variables scenario: 

supersoft channel: SN1a with either MS or subgiant companion

helmholtz equation of state: looks like a really fast equation of state that outputs smooth and continuous derivatives of specifc entropy
specific internal energy, and pressure. Also guarantees thermodynamic consistency

inviscid: a fluid that isn't thick

thermodynamic consistency: when the entropy and temperature are well defined by an EOS - particularly important when
hydrodynamics is coupled with other fields of physics
(for more info, look in mphys folder, article titled "some comments on thermodynamic consistency")


Modified mixing length theory: allows for simulation of convection to vary depending on opacity

zero age main sequence: a star that has just reached the MS 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS THE PAPER ABOUT?

simulated a SN1a for a bunch of stars to see if any of them are similar to Tycho G, a suspected companion star
of SN1572




WHAT DID THEY FIND OUT?

the closest model had the same effective temperature as tycho G and also managed to match its slow rotation speed
but the simulations luminosity and radius are twice as large

found that the stars expand post impact and continue to expand for about 1000 years before contracting

and that the evolution of the str depends on how much energy it absorbed and how deep the energy penetrated into the star

all stars modelled started out with a metallicity of Z=0.02




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
introduction notes:
they know there is a mass transfer phase for at least some of the SN1a explosions because there exists some 
pre-supernova circumstellar medium within the supernovae reminants

tycho G- high proper motion, low rotation speed <7.5km/s. SD scenario predicts high proper motion but you would
expect companion star to also have high rotational speed due to fast rotating orbits prior to explosion

But this is only the case when you dont consider how the star evolves post supernova


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
some interesting notes on the optically thick wind accretion model (OTWA model):

A study conducted by EVLA, observations on SN2011fe found that OTWA model was not present, but OTWA model can explain the circumstellar
torus around SN2005gj SN2002ic SN2006X
Also, delay time distributions predicted by this model are consistent with what is observed
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NUMERICAL METHODS

EOS used is the helmholtz equation of state

The mixing-length theory of convection used is the modified MLT by Henyey et al. (1965)

As with the paper on He star companion, the mass loss phase is constant to simplify things such that only the end result after 
mass loss finishes matters--final result matches with what is predicted by Hachisu et al

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESULTS

10-20% of companion mass is lost due to the explosion and ejecta ripping away surface material from the star
Interestingly, model C has a luminosity past supernova of 44 L_solar, whereas the rest range from 13-22 L_solar
