shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and makes the operating system do them

------------------------------------------lesson 1 +2--------------------------------------------------------
GUI- graphical user interface----like settings 
CLI- command line interface------like terminal
mutually exclusive: cnnot occur at the same time

unix has many shells: bash (Borne Again SHell), ksh, tcsh, zsh

terminal? a program that lets you interact with the shell

emulator: allows one computer system to behave like another

superuser: means you have admin privaleges, if last character on shell prompt is # instead of $

highlight text paste it to terminal by pressing middle button on mouse or left and right buttons on touch pad

root directory= the first directory, contained within in are subdirectories and files, represented by a /
working directory= the directory you are currently in

home directory= directory you are in when you first log in

going back to your parent directory: cd ..
single . means the working directory 

absolute pathname: to change directories using absolute pathnames, only add / at the start if you are in the root directory

changing to the home directory: cd 

change to the working directory you were previously on: cd -

ls -a will show all hidden directories and files too. hidden files or directories have a . preceeding their name

when naming files, limit puntuation to -._ no spaces

---------------------------------------------lesson 3----------------------------------------------------------------
structure of commands: command -options arguements 
command is stuff like ls, options are the extra optional shit you can do with the command, arguement is the other stuff you 
want the command to operate on 

listing files in long format: ls -l
listing files in a certain directory: ls <directory>
listing hidden files and normal files and directories in long format: ls -la (can be -al too, order doesnt matter)

long format: - indicates file, d indicates directory. the next set of character indicates the permissions (read write etc)
next is the person who owns the file, then the group of people who also have access to the file/directory, then its the 
size of the file in bytes, modification date, and file name at the end

displaying a text file: less <textfile, no extension needed>,  to quit, press q
you can scroll through the pages using up and down arrows
go to the end of the file: g
go to the start of the file: 1g
to find a word, type /<word>
to see a complete list of shit you can do in less, type h

to see what kind a file something is: type file <file name> !you must be in the same directory to do this
---------------------------------lesson4--------------------------------------------------

mounting: when you attach a physical device to the tree of directories. devices are treated like files
mount points: are points in the directory tree where devices are mounted

------------------------------------lesson 5----------------------------------------------
manipulating files

wildcards: 

i*.dat   specifies any files that begin with i and end with .dat in the current working directory

big??     specifies any files that begin with the word big followed by 2 characters

[abq]*  specifies any files that begin with a, b or q

[[:alnum:]]* specifies any files that start with alpha numeric characters  

[[:digit:]]*    "       "    "     "    "    "    number characters

[[:alpha:]]*   "       "    "     "    "    "    alphabetic characters

[!abq]*        "       "    "     "   dont start with a b or q

[[:upper:]]* for upper case letters

[[:lower:]] for lower case letters
-------------------------------
copies the first declared file or directory, and pastes it into the second declared file or directory: cp 
(add -r for directories)
fore files, this command overwrites the old file (second declared one) and just sticks the new stuff in
if the 2nd declared file or directory doesnt exist, then it makes it
for directories, it does NOT overwrite the directory

can copy a file into a directory

when using cp, file and directory must be in the same directory

interactive option: -i, basically notifies you that you will be overwriting something, but doesnt allow for the option of 
not overwriting
--------------------------
moving or renaming files or directories: mv
if you have in your arguments 2 files, the first declared file is renamed to the second. if the second file name is  file 
that already exists, then its contents are replaced with that of the first declared file, and the 1st declared file no 
longer exists.

for directories: if you have 2 directories, mv will move dir1 to dir2 if dir2 does not exist
error message will come up if dir1 doesnt exist


use of mv in moving files into directories: can move multiple files into a directory all in the same line
mv file1 file2 file3 dir1
--------------------------
removing files or directories: rm
--------------------------
creating directories: mkdir

----------------------------------------lesson 6--------------------------------------------------
different types of commands:

executable programs: programs written in a language that does shit when you run them
shell builtins: built in commands within bash that allows you to do shit like
alias: commands you make yourself to do stuff 
shell functions: not sure, add details later 

finding out the type of command something is: type <enter command here>

which command: dont really know what this is 

finding out more informationa about a certain shell builtin: help <command name> 
example---> help cd. !any verticle lines | means these two options are mutually exclusive 

finding out more information about a certain executable program: <command name> --help 
doesnt work for all executable programs

an alternative for executable programs is: man <command>

if you find a .gz file, it means its compressed using gzip program, and to view it, use zless instea of less

----------------------------------------lesson 7------------------------------------------------------

standard input/output: input/output from the keyboard/terminal respectively

how to change the output of a command to write into a file: <command> > file.dat
example: ls > file.dat !this will print out the list of files and directories onto the file "file.dat" but will overwrite
each time 
to get rid of the overwrite behaviour: replace > with >>
(memonic: command OUTput > because it points outwards, command INput < because it points inwards)
