root directory= the first directory, contained within in are subdirectories and files, represented by a /
working directory= the directory you are currently in

home directory= directory you are in when you first log in

going back to your parent directory: cd ..
single . means the working directory 

absolute pathname: to change directories using absolute pathnames, only add / at the start if you are in the root directory

changing to the home directory: cd 

change to the working directory you were previously on: cd -

ls -a will show all hidden directories and files too. hidden files or directories have a . preceeding their name

when naming files, limit puntuation to -._ no spaces

structure of commands: command -options arguements 
command is stuff like ls, options are the extra optional shit you can do with the command, arguement is the other stuff you 
want the command to operate on 

listing files in long format: ls -l
listing files in a certain directory: ls /<absolute pathname of directory>
listing hidden files and normal files and directories in long format: ls -la (can be -al too, order doesnt matter)

long format: - indicates file, d indicates directory. the next set of character indicates the permissions (read write etc)
next is the person who owns the file, then the group of people who also have access to the file/directory, then its the 
size of the file in bytes, modification date, and file name at the end

displaying a text file: less <textfile, no extension needed>,  to quit, press q
you can scroll through the pages using up and down arrows
go to the end of the file: g
go to the start of the file: 1g
to find a word, type /<word>
to see a complete list of shit you can do in less, type h

to see what kind a file something is: type file <file name> !you must be in the same directory to do this

mounting: when you attach a physical device to the tree of directories. devices are treated like files
