TERMINOLOGY

violent merger model: WD's merge through tidal distruptions of the secondary, igniting fusion (in the primary or seconday?)
but the total mass doesnt need to be higher than chandrasekhar mass as the fusion is ignited by hydronamical effects

D6 model: dynamically driven double degenerate double detonation model, also called the Helium ignited violent merger model
essentially shock compression of He in a system that doesnt need to have super chandrasekhar mass, and not much helium 0.01 SM

hypervelocity: velocity >= 1,000 km/s

WHAT IS THE PAPER ABOUT?

double detonation of 2 CO WD, they followed the evolution of the surviving WD from He inigition, CO ignition, then the
interaction between the ejecta and the surviving WD. All using smooth particle hydrodynamics on super chandrasekhar mass
binary systems

Found that the surviving companion captures Ne 56 and He which is visible on its surface

SN ejecta would be composed of unburnt material as well as "companion origin steam" which depends on the relative 
abundances of the C0 white dwarfs

paper predicts that although simulations were made only on super chadrasekhar mass binary systems, similar features 
should also appear in sub-chandrasekhar mass systems
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION NOTES:
if we take into account the idea that both super and sub chandrasekhar mass explosions result in SN1a then the DD
scenario can explain the observed rates of SNe 1a explosions 

D6 model favoured because you dont need as much helium as you do in DD scenario, where at least 0.1 SM is needed 
to produce the helium signature it predicts 

D6 is distinct because it expects the companion star to have hyper velocity as it gets really close to the primary before the
explosion occurs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

METHOD

they use Helmholtz EOS without coloumb corrections 

paper doesn't model the pre-explosion mass transfer phase

INITIAL CONDITIONS: primary C0 white dwarf with 0.95 SM CO core, 0.05 SM helium shell. secondary CO WD, 0.6 SM with no 
helium shell because it is assumed that the helium shell has all been transferred to the Primary by the time the explosion
occurs 
outermost shell of primary has a mix of He (Y=0.6) and CO (each 0.2), apparently this mixing also helps facilitate He 
ignition
