import pandas as pd

dataframe (is referred to in python as df): like the table of data. consists of index(like rows) with index label 
(can be row number), columns with column label,and values (data)

row or column are often refered to as an axis

subset selection (also called indexing): when you select particular rows and/or columns within the dataframe

integer location: the number assigned to an partiular row or column. starts from 0, goes to n-1

indexers: commands that help you index/subset select. they are [], .iloc, .loc
BUT df[] is also called the indexing operator

COMMAND read_csv('sample_data.csv', index_col=0): reads in a comman seperated data set called sample_data.csv, and 
focuses on the column n=0

ensure arugments within read_csv are .csv files, you can convert them by renaming it with the .csv extension. but this will
not add commas so everything will be treated as an index
