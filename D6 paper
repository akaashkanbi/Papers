questions: what is star ID?
TERMINOLOGY


D6 model: dynamically driven double degenerate double detonation model, also called the Helium ignited violent merger model
essentially shock compression of He in a system that doesnt need to have super chandrasekhar mass, and not much helium 0.01 SM
helium ignition causes carbon to ignite

difference between d6 and Iax is that Iax's primary survives and in the D6 scenario is necessary for their to be a white companion

hypervelocity: velocity >= 1,000 km/s

instability: when a perturbation starts to grow, it will continue to grow 

Kelvin-helmholtz instability: when you have two fliuds with one moving relative to another, and there is a slight perturbation
on one along the interface, this perturbation grows into something resembling a wave pattern

interesting video on kelvin helmholtz instability :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgamfo86FQo

Rayleigh-taylor instability: when you have an density inversion (more dense on top of less dense) and so the less dense
tries to rise, the more dense tries to fall. this perturbation along the interface continues to grow giving a "finger" pattern

companion origin stream: a stream of particles found in the ejecta shadow due to the interaction between the secondary and
ejecta 

stochastic: probabilistic system that can be analysed statistically but no precise predictions can be made

deflagration: whens something burns, and the heat from that burns the thing closest to it. subsonic method of heat transfer

delayed-detonation model: slow burning in the CO core before detonation occurs, allows for the creation of intermediatary 
elements

shockwave nucleosynthesis: how a lot of elements in stars are expected to be created

photodissociation is photodisintegration for chemical compounds, disintegration occurs in nuclei

Si I means neutral silicon. Si II means singly ionised silicon, S III means doubly ionised Si and so on

SOME NOTES ON SPH
the particles of the system become the "mesh" without actually having a mesh

the properties of a particle are found by interpolating the property of neighbouring particles

WHAT IS THE PAPER ABOUT?

double detonation of 2 CO WD, they followed the evolution of the surviving WD from He inigition, CO ignition, then the
interaction between the ejecta and the surviving WD. All using smooth particle hydrodynamics on super chandrasekhar mass
binary systems

Found that the surviving companion captures Ne 56 and He which is visible on its surface

SN ejecta would be composed of unburnt material as well as "companion origin steam" which depends on the relative 
abundances of the C0 white dwarfs

paper predicts that although simulations were made only on super chadrasekhar mass binary systems, similar features 
should also appear in sub-chandrasekhar mass systems
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION NOTES:
if we take into account the idea that both super and sub chandrasekhar mass explosions result in SN1a then the DD
scenario can explain the observed rates of SNe 1a explosions 

D6 model favoured because you dont need as much helium as you do in DD scenario, where at least 0.1 SM is needed 
to produce the signature of helium detonation it predicts 

D6 is distinct because it expects the companion star to have hyper velocity, as it gets really close to the primary before the
explosion occurs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

METHOD

they use Helmholtz EOS without coloumb corrections 

paper doesn't model the pre-explosion mass transfer phase

INITIAL CONDITIONS: primary C0 white dwarf with 0.95 SM CO core, 0.05 SM helium shell. secondary CO WD, 0.6 SM with no 
helium shell because it is assumed that the helium shell has all been transferred to the Primary by the time the explosion
occurs 
outermost shell of primary has a mix of He (Y=0.6) and CO (each 0.2), apparently this mixing also helps facilitate He 
ignition

2 simulations performed, one of which has a higher mass resolution (more particles in the simulation, more continuous?)

obitial plane is in x-y, angular momentum vector in the z axis. origin is barycenter

the ejecta was found to have a spherically symmetric shape, did they not consider an offcenter explosion? such an event might not be realistic as 
the He detonation is expected to converge at the center
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESULTS

elements within the ejecta: Fe, chromium, Ni56, Si and S, O, C,Ar, Ca, and Ti, and He in order from the inside of the ejecta
these are all elements that can occur due to photo ejection processes from alpha particle capture.

He detonation first, spreads around the shell, shockwave seperates helium from C0 core, shockwave converges causing CO detonation,
and eventually thermonuclear explosion

shockwave seen as a density and pressure discontinuity

CO detonation synthesises the nickel 56, He detonation synthesizes the Si Ca and Ti elements

chemical composition synthesized agrees with recent studies with differences arising due to the fact that they had 
included mixing of CO with He in the He shell, which is more accurate

found that the chemical composition is independent of mass resolution, no significant discrepencies

companion origin stream 50 50 C O composition, with Ne Mg and Si being formed from shock heating during collision of 
ejecta and companion

a detonation propagating through high density CO create only Ni-56 and none of the intermediatary elements
but if the density is lowered, you can have creation of intermediatary elements : https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0409598.pdf

density can be decreased if deflagration occurs beforehand---dont quite understand the physics behind this
this is because deflagration can lift degeneracy given that its slowly burning and increasing the thermal energy past the internal energy
due to degeneracy

delay detonation model has C0 extended across different speeds, D6 model predicts CO only at two different speeds
but they have similarities in the speeds of the other elements created

origin of the low speed C+0 is due to the companion origin stream, high speed C+O comes from the exploded material from the 
primary

ejecta propagates in the opposite direction as survivor, primary is expected to be moving at 1,100 km/s, secondary at 1700
m/s. 


----------------the surviving companion-----------------------------

surviving companion moves at a constant velocity of 1700 from time of explosion to t=50 seconds

All elements have higher velocity components when viewed in the direction of the eject

surviving companion loses some mass from interactions with the ejecta, but also captures some material, mainly Nickel56 (0.03 SM) and some helium.
mass post explosion = 0.6SM

Ni 56 and He captured because they have low velocity.
C+0 detonation forms nickel in rapid nuclear reactions, which also form helium as a byproduct of photodissociation in the center

they found that the internal structure of the surviving WD is virtually undamaged when comparing density, temperature, and entropy profiles.
it also keeps its C0 core

external structure is changed by the ejecta, the survivor gains an envelope consisting of Ni C 0 He in decending order of mass amounts
it previously had an envelope of C+O but now gained some nickel and He. Envelope is hot

DISCUSSION:
-----------the exploding primary--------------------------------
In the discussion, they omit any details of Ca Ti Ar because they are formed due to helium detonation. In their model, they only used a thick He
shell because it would allow the explosion to occur more easily. In reality when observing something like this, the helium shell can be much thinner 
and so you wouldnt expect to get the same signatures of Ca Ti Ar

then they start to match d6 model with the observational features of some SNeIa:
SN2010lp which has blue and redshifted oxygen streams, D6 model can produce either blue or reshifted oxygen streams because the ejecta is travelling opposite
to the survivor

might not see the oxygen features because in reality the secondary can still have a helium shell and so the ejecta companion interaction may not be able to 
strip as much O, the helium gets in the way. But there will be some Oxygen because there is mixing between the He and C+0 layers

Also, higher mass WD have smaller He shells, so it wouldnt get in the way all the time, just depends on the progenitor system

section finishes off by talking about SNe Ia with either of blue- or redshifted Fe-group emissions can be also explained by the D6model.

-------the surviving companion--------------------------
Nickel on WD surfaces gives off radiation in the form of post-SN winds which is relavant to my WD as it has a hot nickel envelope

study by kenshen had nickel mass much less bound than nomotos simulation

they considered the effect of accretion of instellar medium and interstellar objects and found the it would have a neglible effect on the surface composition
found that roughly 10**13g of matter would be accreted. Assumed the wd would be travelling through the galatic disk
this was calculated by considering bondi accretion which is accretion at a rate assuming that the escape velocity is approximately at sound speed and 
that we have a spherical compact object travelling through the interstellar medium at some specified velocity

Helium doesnt experience gravitational settling/sedimentation so one might expect to see this on the surface, but this is not indicative of a d6 surviving wd
this is because normal wd form helium on their surface anyway, and the surface needs to be really hot for He detection anyway. as the wd cools this means that 
helium might not be seen

D6 explosions should have oxygen emission lines in their nebula phase spectra, some supernoave like SN2010lp andiPTF14atg have this line.

as d6 predicts a survivor, d6 explosions expect for fe group elements to have either blue shifted or red shifted emission lines in the nebular phase 
as the ejecta follows conservation of momentum

description of the d6 light curve: at an early time, its light curve may show a UV pulse due to radioactive nuclei yielded by the He detonation. 
At the maximum-light time, its spectra indicate Si absorption lines similarly to ordinary SNe Ia.
