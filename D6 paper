questions: what is star ID?
TERMINOLOGY


D6 model: dynamically driven double degenerate double detonation model, also called the Helium ignited violent merger model
essentially shock compression of He in a system that doesnt need to have super chandrasekhar mass, and not much helium 0.01 SM
helium ignition causes carbon to ignite

hypervelocity: velocity >= 1,000 km/s

instability: when a perturbation starts to grow, it will continue to grow 

Kelvin-helmholtz instability: when you have two fliuds with one moving relative to another, and there is a slight perturbation
on one along the interface, this perturbation grows into something resembling a wave pattern

interesting video on kelvin helmholtz instability :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgamfo86FQo

Rayleigh-taylor instability: when you have an density inversion (more dense on top of less dense) and so the less dense
tries to rise, the more dense tries to fall. this perturbation along the interface continues to grow giving a "finger" pattern

companion origin stream: a stream of particles found in the ejecta shadow due to the interaction between the secondary and
ejecta 

stochastic: probabilistic system that can be analysed statistically but no precise predictions can be made

deflagration: whens something burns, and the heat from that burns the thing closest to it. subsonic method of heat transfer

delayed-detonation model: slow burning in the CO core before detonation occurs, allows for the creation of intermediatary 
elements

SOME NOTES ON SPH
the particles of the system become the "mesh" without actually having a mesh

the properties of a particle are found by interpolating the property of neighbouring particles

WHAT IS THE PAPER ABOUT?

double detonation of 2 CO WD, they followed the evolution of the surviving WD from He inigition, CO ignition, then the
interaction between the ejecta and the surviving WD. All using smooth particle hydrodynamics on super chandrasekhar mass
binary systems

Found that the surviving companion captures Ne 56 and He which is visible on its surface

SN ejecta would be composed of unburnt material as well as "companion origin steam" which depends on the relative 
abundances of the C0 white dwarfs

paper predicts that although simulations were made only on super chadrasekhar mass binary systems, similar features 
should also appear in sub-chandrasekhar mass systems
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION NOTES:
if we take into account the idea that both super and sub chandrasekhar mass explosions result in SN1a then the DD
scenario can explain the observed rates of SNe 1a explosions 

D6 model favoured because you dont need as much helium as you do in DD scenario, where at least 0.1 SM is needed 
to produce the signature of helium detonation it predicts 

D6 is distinct because it expects the companion star to have hyper velocity, as it gets really close to the primary before the
explosion occurs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

METHOD

they use Helmholtz EOS without coloumb corrections 

paper doesn't model the pre-explosion mass transfer phase

INITIAL CONDITIONS: primary C0 white dwarf with 0.95 SM CO core, 0.05 SM helium shell. secondary CO WD, 0.6 SM with no 
helium shell because it is assumed that the helium shell has all been transferred to the Primary by the time the explosion
occurs 
outermost shell of primary has a mix of He (Y=0.6) and CO (each 0.2), apparently this mixing also helps facilitate He 
ignition

2 simulations performed, one of which has a higher mass resolution (more particles in the simulation, more continuous?)

obitial plane is in x-y, angular momentum vector in the z axis. origin is barycenter

the ejecta was found to have a spherically symmetric shape, did they not consider an offcenter explosion?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESULTS

elements within the ejecta: Fe, chromium, Ni56, Si and S, O, C,Ar, Ca, and Ti, and He in order from the inside of the ejecta
these are all elements that can occur due to photo ejection processes from alpha particle capture processes.

He detonation first, spreads around the shell, shockwave seperates helium from C0 core, shockwave converges causing CO detonation,
and eventually thermonuclear explosion

shockwave seen as a density and pressure discontinuity

CO detonation synthesises the nickel 56, He detonation synthesizes the Si Ca and Ti elements

chemical composition synthesized agrees with recent studies with differences arising due to the fact that they had 
included mixing of CO with He in the He shell, which is more accurate

found that the chemical composition is independent of mass resolution, no significant discrepencies

companion origin stream 50 50 C O composition, with Ne Mg and Si being formed from shock heating during collision of 
ejecta and companion

a detonation propagating through high density CO create only Ni-56 and none of the intermediatary elements
but if the density is lowered, you can have creation of intermediatary elements : https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0409598.pdf

density can be decreased if deflagration occurs beforehand---dont quite understand the physics behind this

delay detonation model has C0 extended across different speeds, D6 model predicts CO only at two different speeds
but they have similarities in the speeds of the other elements created

origin of the low speed C+0 is due to the companion origin stream, high speed C+O comes from the exploded material from the 
primary

ejecta propagates in the opposite direction as survivor, primary is expected to be moving at 1,100 km/s, secondary at 1700
m/s. 

surviving companion moves at a constant velocity of 1700 from time of explosion to t=50 seconds

All elements have higher velocity components when viewed in the direction of the ejecta
