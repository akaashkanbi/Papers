activity 2 notes

need to complete a form

for data, you can choose between data given by your supervisors, or data given by uni for the given data we are given a 
corresponding labscript

!discuss with rob and zhengwei, see if its better to have data from him or use data from uni??


what is the purpose of a paper?
it is the end product of scientific research, its about reviewing what is known supported by the current 
literature, and supporting new ideas or existing ideas using evidence gained in the research process

the paper should be written such that the reader can follow your line of arguement and reproduce any results youve stated

what is the max length? 
4 A4 sides

letters: short papers that are meant to convey important new results to the physics community

tips from "some simple rules of writing" https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/199806/rules.cfm
-write concisely, explain things in the least amount of jargon possible
-clear thinking is clear writing
-make sure you understand what you've learnt
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
journal i will be writing for: physical review letters
editorial guidlines for this journal:
must have something to add to the conversation, and something significant at that, not just some marginal insight

The goal of PRL is to keep a broad readership of physicists well informed of the essential current research in all subfields
-------------------------------------------
The letter must start with an introduction-what is the problem that it addresses? what does the paper achieve?
must be understandable by physicists in other subfields.
what is the background behind this work?
why is the research important? what other fields can this research be benefitual in?
-------------------------------------------
supplimental material- section containing additional shit like long tables, computer code etc that would usually break the flow
-------------------------------------------
only use new terminology when needed, dont use too many acronyms
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

leave abstract, title for last, no need for keywords
