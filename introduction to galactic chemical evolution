period of high number of stars being born. results in all or most of the gas reserviors being depleted on a timescale much
shorter than the age of the galaxy

often occurs when the galaxy is about to merge with another or is in a close encounter

TERMINOLOGY

stellar yields: mass of a chemical elements produced by different stars. the star doesnt need to produce it via fusion,
the element could have just been inside it when the star formed
mathematically expressed as (the integral over the stellar lifetime of the mass loss rate * difference in abundance of that
element) + initial abundance*mass loss

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
chemical evolution of galaxies: how elements within stars are formed and distributed around the galaxy

chemical evolution models aim to look at the distribution of these chemicals and how they evolve with time, to build one 
you need to consider:

initial conditions. is star formation gas here from the beginning or was is accreted in at a later time?
is the gas made of primodial elements or is it enriched?

construction of the stellar birthrate function--> b(m,t) = Star formation rate(t) * initial mass function (m)

initial mass function(IMF) = tells us the distribution of stars at birth, estimated as a power law

star formation rate (SFR) = v*signma^k where v is efficiency = star formation rate per unit mass
sigma^k is the gas surface mass density
this model neglects gas temperature, magnetic field and viscousity

NOTE: low intermediate mass stars produce H He C N O, low mass stars dont contribute to the chemical evolution of a galaxy
because their lifetime is longer than hubble time

Also required for a galactic model is consideration of inflowing/outflowing gas: outflowing gas proportional to the 
stellar birthrate, inflowing are assumed to be constant or decreasing exponentially, it serves to dilute the metal content 
of the star

the instanteous recycling approximation (IRA) is also used: stars>1 solar mass die instanteously, stars<1 solar mass live forever
useful in computing the abundances of elements that form quickly in core collapse like O, but a poor approximaation for 
elements that form over the long term like Fe

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The simple model: assumes IRA, no inflow or outflow of gas, IMF is constant in time, primodial gas, mixing between ISM and 
newly produced gas is instanteous

effective yield: stellar yield when assuming the simple model, always larger than true yield

primary element: element that originated from H or He
secondary element: element that was originally in the star at birth, proportional to Z^2 (metalicity)
