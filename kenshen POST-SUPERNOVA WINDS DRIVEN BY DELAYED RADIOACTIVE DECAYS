abstract------------------------
ni to co is electron capture process, creates winds which were simulated
conflicts of wind with 2011fe but uncertainties in calculations mean that wd donors cant be completely ruled out


introduction-------------------------------
ni produced is ionised but doesnt stay ionised for long as it expands and cools, becoming partially ionised so 
that k shell electron captures can occur resulting in decay processes

but this is supressed if the ni56 remains ionised 

bound Ni56 masses of 0.006, 0.03, and 0.08 Solar masses for 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 solar mass WD companions, respectively.
but these are upper limit estimates as work done on the ejecta is ignored. but including the work done, the eject has more
energy and so there will be less captured material.

in SNE Iax you have a helium donor star and the deflagration doesnt result in the primary star becoming completely unbound 
it survives as a "zombie"
smaller ejecta mass and less ni56 produced (and so the light curve evolves much more quickly)

this ni56 will be gravitationally bound in an envelope, unable to expand outwards and so remains ionised 
this means that we will have a wind that last for long time

the models considered in the paper are 0.9+0.1 SM (core +envelope) and 0.5SM+0.0SM and Ni56mass fractions within the envelopes of 0.2 and 0.1. anything else inside the 
envelope is assumed to be Fe

paper simulated a star with 1.2 sm and same entropy as what a Iax might have and found that due to removal of 
mass from the center due to relatively incomplete explosion which decreases the gravitational potential energy and thereby 
decreasing density, there will be no convective carbon core burning which might durastically change the stars evolution and lift 
degeneracy.

therefore star is treated as a inert degenerate core with hot envelope

rough approximations to justify simplistic entropy profiles but it is noted that a more relatistic entropy profile could be 
bases for future work
