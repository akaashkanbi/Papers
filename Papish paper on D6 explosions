 SR=solar radius 
 SM= solar mass
this paper, differing from the nomoto paper, uses a he wd donor instead of a CO wd with helium shell around it

Core degenerate scenario: WD merges with the degenerate core of an AGB star In a recent paper, Tsebrenko & Soker(2015b) argue that at least 20 per cent,
and likely many more, of all SNe Ia come from the CD scenario.

WD collision scenario: three stars, two of which are wd. third star through kozav lidov causes the wd to collide. but it is estiamted that this accounts only 
for a few percent of SNeIA

single wd scenario: SNeIa explosion from a single co wd through pyconuclear reactions. essentially an idea that nuclear reactions are enchanced in dense material as 
there is much more screeening which reduces the coloumb barrier. it looks like Hydrogen needs to be ignited which ignites the core, but it is found that the H mass
fraction of the CO wd that cause SNeIA have a really small H mass fraction. Also, looks like this occurs at sub chandrasekhar mass so it can only account for a few
Sne Ia gven that most Ia happen at super chandra mass

introduction:

there is overlap between scenarios, double detonation could occur in core degenerate scenario leading to some hybrid

shockwave induced by ejecta companion interaction leads to He ignition in the companion wd. the study investigates whether this is via adiabatic compression
or by shock heating
the other things it tries to answer are:
what the ejecta looks like after it sweeps through the interstellar medium?
how much helium does the ejecta take away from the donor star?
as carbon burning is enhanced by the presence of helium, does mixing between donor and ejecta lead to vigorious burning?

they looked at two wd of mass 0.43 SM and seperation 0.02 SR from the exploding wd (not random numbers but from  Guillochon et al. (2010), Raskin et al. (2012),
 and Pakmor et al. (2013)) and 0.2 SM separated at a distance of 0.08 SR
 
mass transfer must be unstable for powerful enough ignition to occur

ways in which He WD or the CO ejecta might be ignited post explosion:
shock compression of helium due to ram pressure as it moves through ejecta
SHock compression of C0 in ejecta---conditions are hot enough for this but the dynamical outflow timescale is much shorter than the burning timescale
so no burning happens---???????
carbon ignition when helium mixing happens. enhances carbon burning but the study didnt have mixing deep enough so there was no ignition through this 
mechanism
