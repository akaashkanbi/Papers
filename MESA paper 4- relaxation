module allows for the input of specified entropy angular momentum and composition profiles, relaxes the star into hydrostatic equil

relaxation occurs through pseudo evolution where composition evolution from nuclear burning, mixing, and angular momentum transport is suppressed whilst 
another parameter incrementally evolves to a desired amount 

relaxation reproduces a model in 1D at an accuracy of 0.1%
