QUESTIONS:
why are equation of state tables used? what can they do that equations of state cannot?

TERMINOLOGY:
interface: (computer science) a shared boundary where two parts of a computer can exchange information. could also be where
the human exchanges information with the computer

Libraries: a set of modules

routine/subroutine: perform a specific task within a program, indepedent of the program

numerical instability: when approximation errors become magnified 

stiff differential equation: a differential equation that yields numerically unstable solutions when certain numerical methods are applied,
unless the step size is really small

bad values: infinity or NaN (Not a Number)

preprocessor: program that processes information into a form that is suitable for another program to read

OPAL: a table that helps us calculate opacities 

OP= opacity project, a project to produce more accurate opacity tables?

Linear interpolation: jointing two data points together by a straight line, mu =0 at the start, mu=1 at the end. mu varies
between the two inbetween and you use a formula to interpolate estimates for the data points within.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The paper is outlined as follows:
§2 explains the design and implementation of MESA modules; 
§3-5 describe the numerical, microphysics, and macrophysical modules;
§6 describes the stellar evolution module MESA star; 
§7 presents a series of tests and code comparisons that serve as rudimentary verification and demonstrates
the broader capabilities of of MESA star;
and §8 summarizes the material presented.

page 10 contains a list of all of the modules, what they do, and where you can find more information
 
module mtx: does matrix manipulation

module interp_1d, interp_2d: does interpolation of variables in 1d and 2d respectively

module num: a module that contains the solvers for stiff and non stiff differential equations, and also contains the 
newton-raphson solver

module alert: sends error messages to the terminal

module utils: checks if any numbers given are bad values, and some other stuff

module const: contains all the physical constants used in stellar astrophysics in cgs (centimeter-gram-second) units

module chem: deals with the chemical elements within the system, can take in an arbitrary set of species from the user,
and use it within the simulation


------------------------------------------EOS stuff-----------------------------------------------------------


module eos: contains the equation of state, works with density and temperature**check this module out
EOS used in MESA are helmholtz (HELM), PC, OPAL, SCVH. It switches between these depending on which is most appropriate for 
the temperature density conditions 

eos module also takes in variables X(hydrogen fraction), Z(metal fracion), A_bar(mass averaged atomic weight of metals) and 
Z_bar(mass averaged atomic charge of metals)

MESA density-temperature tables are computed using OPAL EOS for higher temperatures and densities, and for lower T and densities,
SCVH is used for Z<=0.4

when Z>0.4, HELM and PC are used, and are used whenever things are outside the ranges of the MESA table

there is blending that occurs between the zones described by the different EOS's to preserve thermodynamic consistency

HELM and PC assume complete ionisation of substance

HELM EOS accounts for pair production occuring at high temperatures

PC takes into account cystalisation of particles within a cooling white dwarf

eos module takes in variables X(hydrogen fraction), Z(metal fracion), A_bar(mass averaged atomic weight of metals) and 
Z_bar(mass averaged atomic charge of metals)

for details of when each EOS operates, check the graph on page 14

when operating in the PC regime, you must specify all mass fractions of isotopes above 0.01 to correctly handle isotope mixing


--------------------------------------------opacities---------------------------------------------------------------------
inside the kap module there is make_kap which makes opacity tables using electron conduction opacities and radiative opacities
also takes into account pair production effects on the opacity

types of opacity tables: type 1: fixed metal distributions and work in the range 0<X<1-Z and 0<Z<0.1
                         type 2: In this table you can have varying amounts of C an O, 0<x<0.7 and 0<Z<0.1 all less than/equal
                         
                         MESA opacity tables are derived from these two types

there is blending occuring between the zones dominated by different opacity tables- perhaps a source of error when we 
are close to the boundaries?

the kap module finds opacity by interpolating in log T and log R
