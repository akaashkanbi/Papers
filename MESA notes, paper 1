QUESTIONS:
why are equation of state tables used? what can they do that equations of state cannot?

TERMINOLOGY:
interface: (computer science) a shared boundary where two parts of a computer can exchange information. could also be where
the human exchanges information with the computer

Libraries: a set of modules

routine/subroutine: perform a specific task within a program, indepedent of the program

numerical instability: when approximation errors become magnified 

stiff differential equation: a differential equation that yields numerically unstable solutions when certain numerical methods are applied,
unless the step size is really small

bad values: infinity or NaN (Not a Number)

preprocessor: program that processes information into a form that is suitable for another program to read

OPAL: a table that helps us calculate opacities 

OP= opacity project, a project to produce more accurate opacity tables?

Linear interpolation: jointing two data points together by a straight line, mu =0 at the start, mu=1 at the end. mu varies
between the two inbetween and you use a formula to interpolate estimates for the data points within.
its simple but has a lot of discontinuity

Cubic interpolation: requires 4 data points instead of 2, but the function is more continuous and is a closer match to the
truth

gravitational settling: jargon for particles moving in accordance to gravity, gravitational settling and radiative levitation
are opposing phenomena

radiative levitation: when the abundances of heavier elements is higher than expected from spectroscopy of the photosphere.
happens when partially ionised heavy elements absorb photons from the core becuase they have larger absorption cross sections
the photon imparts the particle(s) with momentum causing them to rise to the photosphere

modularity: the degree to which modules which are connected compartments can be decoupled and can interact amoung themselves
as opposed to different communities

He flash: runaway fusion of helium in low mass stars when gravitational pressure contrats the helium core into degenerate matter,
thermal instability here results in a rapid increase in helium fusion

grey atmosphere approximation: an approximation by eddington which assumes: radiative equilibrium, constant absorption 
co-efficient (how easily something can be penetrated by energy matter or waves)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The paper is outlined as follows:
§2 explains the design and implementation of MESA modules; 
§3-5 describe the numerical, microphysics, and macrophysical modules;
§6 describes the stellar evolution module MESA star; 
§7 presents a series of tests and code comparisons that serve as rudimentary verification and demonstrates
the broader capabilities of of MESA star;
and §8 summarizes the material presented.

page 10 contains a list of all of the modules, what they do, and where you can find more information
 
module mtx: does matrix manipulation

module interp_1d, interp_2d: does interpolation of variables in 1d and 2d respectively

module num: a module that contains the solvers for stiff and non stiff differential equations, and also contains the 
newton-raphson solver

module alert: sends error messages to the terminal

module utils: checks if any numbers given are bad values, and some other stuff

module const: contains all the physical constants used in stellar astrophysics in cgs (centimeter-gram-second) units

module chem: deals with the chemical elements within the system, can take in an arbitrary set of species from the user,
and use it within the simulation


------------------------------------------EOS stuff-----------------------------------------------------------


module eos: contains the equation of state, works with density and temperature**check this module out
EOS used in MESA are helmholtz (HELM), PC, OPAL, SCVH. It switches between these depending on which is most appropriate for 
the temperature density conditions 

eos module also takes in variables X(hydrogen fraction), Z(metal fracion), A_bar(mass averaged atomic weight of metals) and 
Z_bar(mass averaged atomic charge of metals)

MESA density-temperature tables are computed using OPAL EOS for higher temperatures and densities, and for lower T and densities,
SCVH is used for Z<=0.4

when Z>0.4, HELM and PC are used, and are used whenever things are outside the ranges of the MESA table

there is blending that occurs between the zones described by the different EOS's to preserve thermodynamic consistency

HELM and PC assume complete ionisation of substance

HELM EOS accounts for pair production occuring at high temperatures

PC takes into account cystalisation of particles within a cooling white dwarf

for details of when each EOS operates, check the graph on page 14

when operating in the PC regime, you must specify all mass fractions of isotopes above 0.01 to correctly handle isotope mixing


--------------------------------------------opacities---------------------------------------------------------------------
inside the kap module there is make_kap which makes opacity tables using electron conduction opacities and radiative opacities
also takes into account pair production effects on the opacity

types of opacity tables: type 1: fixed metal distributions and work in the range 0<X<1-Z and 0<Z<0.1
                         type 2: In this table you can have varying amounts of C an O, 0<x<0.7 and 0<Z<0.1 all less than/equal
                         
                         MESA opacity tables are derived from these two types

there is blending occuring between the zones dominated by different opacity tables- perhaps a source of error when we 
are close to the boundaries?

the kap module allows you to choose between type 1 or type 2 tables (but you need to specify the intial C and 0),
and choose between linear or cubic interpolation

opacity is not that important for convection

light blue=convective, green=radiative

other_kap module: allows you to add in additional sources of opacity if you require
karo=module with an opacity from other sources

---------------------------------------thermonuclear and weak reactions--------------------------------------------

rates module: contains all the reaction rates happening within a star for different types of fusion and capture processes

weaklib module: calculates the reaction rates of lepton captures and beta decay rates at high tempertures and densities
often encountered in the later stages of stellar evolution

screen module: takes into account electron screening in thermonuclear reaction rates

neu module: calculates energy loss rate due to neutrinos 


----------------------------------------nuclear reaction networks-----------------------------------------
net module: contains the basic nuclear networks, jina module is used for more complex nuclear networks


----------------------------------------mixing length theory------------------------------------------------
mlt module: implements the mixing length theory

mixing length theory assumes high optical depth and no radiative losses, when this is not the case you can use
modified mixing length theory

----------------------------atmosphere boundary conditions--------------------------------------------------

atm module: computes the temperature and pressure near the surface of the star using an atmospheric model


------------------------------------------diffusion---------------------------------------------------------
Diffusion module: calculates diffusion by solving the burger equation (du/dt +udu/dx = vd2u/dx2, for a given field u(x,t)
with a diffusion co-efficient v) elements within the star are put into classes in accordance to atomic mass, 
each class has a representative element (defined by the user) that all elements within the class are modelled to behave 
similarly to, at least when it comes to diffusion
