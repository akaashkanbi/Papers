module allows for the input of specified entropy angular momentum and composition profiles, relaxes the star into hydrostatic equil

relaxation occurs through pseudo evolution where composition evolution from nuclear burning, mixing, and angular momentum transport is suppressed whilst 
another parameter incrementally evolves to a desired amount 

relaxation reproduces a model in 1D at an accuracy of 0.1%

If you stop a run (control c) you can restart it again by typing ./re x<model number> which is the photo number

saving a model: 
save_model_when_terminate = .true.
save_model_filename = '15M_at_TAMS.mod'  !add these lines to the inlist file

loading a model:
load_saved_model = .true.
saved_model_name = '15M_at_TAMS.mod'  !this line is the model you want to load
$MESA_DIR/star/defaults
check defaults for any parameters you want to add shit like relaxation parameters, found here: $MESA_DIR/star/defaults

relaxing entropy profiles-----------------------------------------------------------------
! `relax_entropy_filename` holds the desired entropy profile information
         ! file format for relax entropy

         !     1st line: num_points
         !     then 1 line for for each point where define desired entropy
         !     xq entropy
         !     xq = fraction of xmstar exterior to the point
         !     where xmstar = mstar - M_center
         !     entropy = specific entropy in units of erg/gr/K

relaxing composition profile-------------------------------------------------------------------------
relax_initial_composition
         !### num_steps_to_relax_composition
         !### relax_composition_filename
         ! relax composition from current to specified over number of steps.
         ! `relax_composition_filename` holds the desired composition profile information
         ! file format for relax composition

         !     1st line: num_points num_species
         !     then 1 line for for each point where define desired composition
         !     xq xa(1) ... xa(num_species)
         !     xq = fraction of xmstar exterior to the point
         !     where xmstar = mstar - M_center
         !     the interpolation routines require that the xq values which
         !     appear in your file must be monotonically increasing
         !     xa(i) = mass fraction of i'th species

         ! NOTE: it is up to you to ensure that the current net isotopes match
         ! the species in the composition file.
         ! You can set `show_net_species_info = .true.` to check the isotopes in the net.

         ! If timescale_for_relax_composition is negative, then the model will be adjusted
         ! such that in num_steps_to_relax_composition the desired composition is obtained.
         ! Otherwise, the abundance of each element will be updated each step as
  new_xa = lambda*target_xa + (1-lambda)*current_xa
         ! where lambda = dt/timescale_for_relax_composition. In this way, the target composition
         ! is reached when dt>=timescale_for_relax_composition.
         
  it looks like I only need entropy and chemical abundance profiles
