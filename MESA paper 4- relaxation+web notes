module allows for the input of specified entropy angular momentum and composition profiles, relaxes the star into hydrostatic equil

relaxation occurs through pseudo evolution where composition evolution from nuclear burning, mixing, and angular momentum transport is suppressed whilst 
another parameter incrementally evolves to a desired amount 

relaxation reproduces a model in 1D at an accuracy of 0.1%

If you stop a run (control c) you can restart it again by typing ./re x<model number> which is the photo number

saving a model: 
save_model_when_terminate = .true.
save_model_filename = '15M_at_TAMS.mod'  !add these lines to the inlist file

loading a model:
load_saved_model = .true.
saved_model_name = '15M_at_TAMS.mod'  !this line is the model you want to load
$MESA_DIR/star/defaults
check defaults for any parameters you want to add shit like relaxation parameters, found here: $MESA_DIR/star/defaults
