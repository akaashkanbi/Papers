TERMINOLOGY



ALL EXPLOSIONS SIMULATED HAD OCCURED AT CHANDRASEKHAR MASS ASSUMING INITIALLY A SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC EXPLOSION

paper predicts colour, magnitude, effective temperature, and photospheric radius of helium and MS companions as function of time
from single degenerate scenario using 3D hydro and 1D stellar evolution of companion 

MS companions must be within 0.6 - 4 Mpc away to be detectable 
He companion must be within 0.4 - 16 Mpc away to be detectable (LMC and M31 great places to look for these companions)

This range was calculated using apparent magnitude of 27 with no extinction

bolometric luminosity gives an estimate for a black body spectrum by looking at one band, and using that to extrapolate the rest
broad band magnitude isnt comfined to a single band and so it gives a more accurate black body spectrum

Colour and magnitude of surviving companions

MS companions: 3 < M (V band) < -1  brightest 500 to 3000 years post explosion which is when most SNe 1a were observed
He companions: 4 < M (B band) < -4   THESE ARE ABSOLUTE MAGNITUDES

Any red giant companions would probably look like helium degenerate cores with shallow H envelopes as most of the envelope would have 
been stripped
