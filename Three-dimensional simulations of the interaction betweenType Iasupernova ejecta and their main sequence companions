TERMINOLOGY:
SNe 1a has no hydrogen lines

ejecta: material that is thrown out during an explosion

donor star: star in which matter is accreted fro

subgiant: star that is brighter than MS but not as bright as giant stars, lies in between the two on a HR diagram (IV)

Nova: H accreted and the hot WD heats it up leading to fusion

cataclysmic variable stars: stars with a luminosity that increases irregularly and by a significant amount before decreasing

transient events: an astronomical event that lasts seconds, days or years as opposed to millions/ billions of year - 
essentially quick events

accretion induced collapse of white dwarf: when a WD accretes matter, nuclear reactions occur near the core and WD 
collapses into neutron star

white dwarf= degenerate dwarf

circumstellar: revolving around or surrounding a star

overshooting parameter: when convection pushes matter into a stable region but because the matter has momentum it goes further
than it should

dynamcially stable: matter accretion is at a rate allowing for there to be no formation of common envelope
roche lobe- teardrop shape around a binary system by which anything within will be gravitationally bound

roche lobe overflow- when there is too much matter in the roche lobe and some of it starts overflowing onto the more 
massive member of the binary system, can be via accretion

common envelope: gas surrounding binary system, when mass transfer is too quick, you get a common envelope which
causes the orbital seperation to decay due to drag forces leading to either a merger or envelope ejection


PURPOSE OF PAPER?

    We dont know whether type1a supernovae are single degenerate or double degenerate
    describes the results of a simulation of type 1a supernovae where the donor star is modeled more realistically
    to conduct the simulation, eggleton stellar evolution code was used


WHAT MADE THE SIMULATION MORE REALISTIC?

    optically thick accretion wind model: model that has strong winds blowing off some matter to allow 
    for stable mass transfer and allow for the birthrates of SNe 1a from simulations to match observations 
    
    took into account accretion disk instabilities (fragmentation of the disk?)
    
    3D hydrodynamic simulation, using smooth particle hydrodynamics code GADGET3

SMOOTH PARTICLE HYDRODYNAMICS?
numerical method that is Mesh free and Lagrangian, assumes du/dt doesnt = 0

RESULTS?

    kick velocity (how fast the ejecta is moving due to explosion?) and stripped mass depend on the the ratio of orbital separation and companion radius
    amount of material stripped depends on structure of companion


SD VS DD

    SD, companion is either MS star, slightly evolved sub giant star, or red giant. WD accretes until chandra limit, explodes. 
    companion survives, which can make the explosion look different
    
    DD, two carbon oxygen white dwarves spiral in and merge, chandra limit exceeded, explosion, no survivors
    
    SD senario can also turn into a novae (premature explosion?), but to avoid this, accretion rate must be above 10-7 solar masses/year
    so that you can get stable hydrogen burning on the surface
    
    In novae,  H accreted and the hot WD heats it up leading to fusion
    
    DD binary systems observed, but a lot of them are too far away for them to merge within the hubble time,
    the ones that are close enough dont have a combined mass exceeding chandra limit. its suggested that DD channel 
    should lead to accretion induced collapse instead of supernovae
    
    recent studies showed equal mass WD can give supernovae with qualities like those observed in real life


to find out if SD OR DD was the correct model, people looked for surviving companions after a SN explosion, 
after one of the explosions, they found a star travelling 3x faster than all neighboring stars
around the area of the supernova, so this makes us think SD may be the correct model

They did it for another SN 1a, found no stars that could be seen, so SD might not be the only channel

also, type 1a supernovae have no hydrogen lines, constrains SD such that there shouldnt be much hydrogen acretion. 
DD fits this observation as long as you have CO WD

simulations of SD senario using 3d smooth particle hydrodynamics were done on the amount of mass stripped from companion, 
found that the stripped mass agrees with observations of survivors, but oversimplified the mass transfer process as it
happening at a constant rate and only using 1D code- this is what the paper aims to improve

other studies showed that disk instabilities increase accretion efficiency substantially

smooth particle hydrodynamics in 3d for GADGET code correctly predicts dynamical effects of SNe 1a, 
shown through comparison with 2D hydrodynamic eulerian simulation which has similarities

numerical noise can be a problem when trying to get a system in hydrostatic equilibrium,
mitigated by allowing the system to relax for a few dynamic timescales
