TERMINOLOGY

Hubble diagram: a graph recession velocity against distance to us.

INTRODUCTION:

SNe 1a are being used to determine the evolution of the the dark energy equation of state

because we don't know which projector system is correct, this could affect the calculation of cosmological parameters
as SNe 1a are used distance markers

As SNe 1a give off lots of KE, they can influence the movement of gases in interstellar and intergalactic medium
this can affect star formation and galaxy evolution

this paper mentions that SNe 1a have no hydrogen or helium lines, but aren't DD characterised by their helium signatures?
The SD scenario is constrained by hydrogen accretion, but their is no mention of Helium constraints in other papers.

SINGLE DEGENERATE MODELS:
optically thick wind proposed to originate from the accreting WD, driven by the luminosity from nuclear burning on its surface
-this wind however might complicate the dynamics of accretion and roche lobe overflow
