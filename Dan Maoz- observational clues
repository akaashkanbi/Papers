TERMINOLOGY

Hubble diagram: a graph recession velocity against distance to us.

kozai-lidov mechanism: when you have perturbation of a third onto a binary system, causes changes in the inclination and eccentricity
of the orbits 

solid body rotation: when all parts of the body maintain a constant distance from the axis of rotation

INTRODUCTION:

SNe 1a are being used to determine the evolution of the the dark energy equation of state

because we don't know which projector system is correct, this could affect the calculation of cosmological parameters
as SNe 1a are used distance markers

As SNe 1a give off lots of KE, they can influence the movement of gases in interstellar and intergalactic medium
this can affect star formation and galaxy evolution
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
basic physics section

this paper mentions that SNe 1a have no hydrogen or helium lines, but aren't DD characterised by their helium signatures?
The SD scenario is constrained by hydrogen accretion, but their is no mention of Helium constraints in other papers.

some carbon and oxygen in SNe 1a are unburnt

SINGLE DEGENERATE MODELS:
optically thick wind proposed to originate from the accreting WD, driven by the luminosity from nuclear burning on its surface
-this wind however might complicate the dynamics of accretion and roche lobe overflow

when accretion is slow, you have a layer of unburnt/cold degenerate hydrogen forming on the outermost layer of the accretor
which can diffuse into the CO core

when accretion rate is too high, hydrogen ignited and mass is retained, but after several thousand H explosions, the He ash
is ignited and almost all of the accreted matter is blown off

DOUBLE DEGENERATE MODELS:
when accretion rate is really high, you can have off-center ignition of C into O and Ne. as mass approaches chandrasekhar,
you get an accretion induced core collapse, low luminosity, transient event

but if the secondary is rotating, accretion can be slowed down and off-center detonation can be avioded

COLLISIONAL DEGENERATE MODELS:
head on collisions of WD, thought to occur in dense stellar clusters

To match observed number of SNe1a, thought to occur in dense stellar environments where you have a triple system, 2WD and a
a low mass star orbiting around. this configuration causes Kozai-lidov oscillations in the eccentricity of the orbits
in the binary leading to faster release of GW and quicker merger time

DOUBLE DETONATION MODELS
rotating WD can be super chandrasekhar in mass, as the rotation adds stability?

these rotating WD can also delay explosions, or not explode at all, as carbon wouldnt be ignited even after the donor has given up
all of its mass. this would effectively erase the existence of the binary system: spin up/spin down scenario

solid body rotation supports up to 1.47 solar masses, so solid body rotation would not be enough to erase binary information

differentially rotating body was proposed, this would support up to 2 solar masses. It is not clear whether this is viable though 
as some argue that this would just become rigid body rotation after baroclinic instabilities (dont get what this is)

but hachisu argues that baroclinic instabilities probably wont happen

SUPERNOVA PHASES
EARLY PHASE, PEAK PHASE-aborption spectra as light is passin through the dense ejecta , you will see
spectra of the other parts of the exploded star LATE PHASE- ejecta has expanded out more
and so we can see emission lines from the core of the star, which is where iron emission spectra can be seen
