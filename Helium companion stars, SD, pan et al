QUESTIONS: why is the depth of energy deposition important?
Does this paper asssume a SNe Iax scenario?


what does "total incident energy from supernova ejecta" mean?

TERMINOLOGY
helium star: O or B star with strong He absorption lines,weak H lines because outer envelope has been stripped off by strong stellar winds from
the interior of the star, or mass transfer to the binary --- it is a in the helium main sequence

PIRS: post impact reminant star

subdwarf: star that is between the main sequence and white dwarf regions on HR diagrams

M-dwarf: M type main sequence star

shock: a disturbance that propagates faster than sound speed in the medium in question, results in dicontinuities in pressure 
density and temperature (P, p T)

subgiant: star that is brighter than the MS star (of same spectral class) but not as bright as giant stars 

SN1ax: supernovae via the HeWD channel (He accreted by a WD from He star) either a helium double detonation explosion 
or CO He WD merger, helium shock compression detonating CO before merger can happen SURVIVING WD- called a zombie star

Double detonations: when He is ignited in the He shell of the white dwarf, causing the supernova to occur before Chandra mass
has been reached- less luminous explosion link:

Delay-time-distribution (DTD): distribution of how long it takes for SN1a to occur since stellar birth
https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/591646/fulltext/22918.text.html 

reverse shock: when stuff gets blown away, and it hits some other stuff causing a shockwave to propagate in the opposing
direction
------------------------------------------------------

WHAT DOES THE PAPER ACCOMPLISH?
they found that helium rich stars expand out and increase in brightness, 10 years after the explosion

radius increases but mass is lost by the companion. also confirmed by comparing the solutions required for HSE before and after the explosion

then they contract into a hot blue subdwarf like star before turning into a helium red giant

A helium companion star should therefore be seen 30 years after the SN explosion within the SN reminant, fast rotating,
high spatial velcity (account for some of the unbounded Hypervelocity stars in our galaxy after doing population synethesis 
calculations)
spactial velocity will decrease once the star expands

hydrosimulations done on 4 He star progenitor models (using FLASH version 3) with different initial masses (1.25, 1.35, 1.4, 1.8
Solar masses, metallicity initally at 0.02, which means 2% of star is not hydrogen or Helium)
He WD channel leaving behind a high velocity 
He subdwarf could explain the number of observed single He subdwarfs 

carbon deflagration: just means carbon detonation

W7 model: looks like the carbon deflagation model with a density distribution described by a power law, and constant temperature
distribution in radius

Introduction notes:

previous studies have been done on MS and sub giant stars- conclusion is that as energy is deposited into the companions
they will be hotter for some time BUT
they didnt do hydrodynamical simulations and so didnt properly calculate shock compression of stellar interior
or how far in the energy from the supernova was deposited

What do hydrodynamical simulations achieve?
they take into account symmetry breaking effects of orbital motion, rotation of the star, and RLOF which can complicate 
how the explosion happens

by taking these into account, pan et al corrected the previous studies and found that MS companions subgiants with higher
luminosity with slow rotation BUT they predicted tycho G to be twice as bright as it is.

He star in SN1ax lose less mass than RG WD or MS WD channel (<5%), also has a smaller time delay (because explosion occurs 
before chandrasekhar mass?)
--------------------------------------------------------------

NUMERICAL CODES AND METHODS 

IMPORTANT: we cannot say that the He star is behaving as an ideal gas nor can we say that the adiabatic exponent is 5/3
as the central density and temp are much higher than MS like stars --------???? as long as V_coloumb<<kT isn't it alright?
no, density is higher so number density will be higher

therefore they update the EOS (equation of state solver) to include the OPAL, SCVH, 
and HELM EOS tables from the eos and kap(describes opacity, dependent on temperature, chemical composition etc) modules
in MESA 
-------------------------------
BEFORE EXPLOSION
uniform composition isn't assumed, but massloss rate is assumed to be constant (artificial assumption, but it allows for
the final masses to fit with detailed binary evolution models by Wang et al 2009, kind of like caring only what happens at
the end)
massloss done in 1D 

HeWDa had a uniform composition distribution before explosion to ensure they didnt get negative entropy gradients or negative
composition gradients-----why is negative entropy gradients bad? means a decrease in entropy with increasing radius, and entropy is a measure of heat energy
per unit of temperature 
--------------------------------

DURING EXPLOSION
converted code into 3D and allowed system to relax for 5 dynamical timescales by damping particle velocity 
to get everything back into hydrostatic equilibrium

W7 model of the SN was used first so that comparisons could be made with other studies



AFTER EXPLOSION

assumed star was in radiative equilibrium, fair considering that stars of this mass have a radiative core with the envelope removed.

initial luminosity profile found by using the temperature gradient, substituting flux for luminosity
relaxation in MESA because the photospheric luminosity and effective temperature were rough?? before evoution was modelled
post explosion
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 evolutionary tracks

HOW ENERGY DEPOSITION WAS CALCULATED: tracer particles were marked. found how much these particles changed in location before and after the explosion
HOW DISTRIBUTION OF ENERGY WAS CALCULATED: they looked at the total energy before explosion, they already knew the energy deposited into the companion,
from this they deduced the remaining energy goes into reverse shocks, unbound mass, and supernovae kick to the ejecta and companion

why is binding energy increased after the SN impact? energy is injected into the star and so the total energy i.e binding
energy increases, but the modulus of the binding energy is actually decreasing as the total energy is negative

dont understand why the initial binding energy doesnt include the energy that the unbound mass has even its bound initially:
Its because energy is deposited into the star when shock heating occurs from ejecta companion interaction. this energy 
deposited affects the binding energy of the star causing some material to have the energy to become unbound. initial binding
energy refers to the binding energy before the explosion occurs

what are these fractional masses in the figures referring to?


time steps: t=10^-8 years for the first 10^-6 years, then they let MESA determine the time step for the rest of the evolution

they looked at the total energy given to the supernova ejecta and compared it to the energy given to the companion 
(found by calculating the binding energy), 40-60% of the ejecta energy is given to the companion.

remaining energy is given to the unbound mass that was accreted from the companion, some carried away due to any 
reverse shocks

He stars are more compact and so there is less time needed for local radiative diffusion

star expands outwards (fits with what ive learnt) leading to more energy being able to escape, effective temperature also 
increases as luminosity given off is higher (more radiation will be escaping) this allows for more cooling and so
the star cools down after some time------complete tomorrow
