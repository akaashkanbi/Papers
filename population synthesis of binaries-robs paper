TERMINOLOGY:

Algol: a three star system

thermally pulsing AGB: a stage in the AGB phase, helium is fused in the E-AGB phase, when this runs out you go to the TP-AGB
stage where hydrogen is burned, making helium. helium builds up and suddenly ignites- helium shell flash

synthetic stellar evolution code: when the model run time for each star is <= 1 second
detailed stellar evolution code: "run time is > 1 second

abstract

we cant model binaries well becuase they are so complex. we observe stars and deduce the parameters needed to build
simulations, then run them and see whats different. then we use this data to figure out any unknown physics

introduction
 
 some stars only form in binary systems, and some process require a secondary to happen i.e supernovae kilarnovae 
 
 some things that are uncertain in binary systems: mass transfer and loss, along with associated angular momentum redistribution
 
 stars take long time to simulate, population of stars even longer, and binary population really long-more stars and more parameters
 to deal with 
 
 triple star systems modelled like binary systems
 
 other shit you need to model in binary systems: "In binary stars we must include the strength of tidal interaction, mass and
 angular momentum transfer efficiencies,mass and angular momentum accretion efficiencies, an algorithm to describe when
 mass transfer is stable, companion induced enhanced mass loss, gravitational radiation angular momentum loss,
 nova explosions and interaction with the ejected material, discs and associated jets, winds and orbital interactions, 
 and supernovakicks"
 
 kroupa mass function: gets crap when M> 10 solar masses, and a little uncertain when M is below this
 
 things that binary_c takes into account and how: Binary-star interaction is included mostly according to Hurley et al. (2002)
 but with improvementsto mass transfer by Roche-lobe overflow (Claeys et al., 2014), Wind-Roche-Lobe-overflow
 (Abate et al., 2013, 2015) , tides (Siess et al., 2013), rejuvenation (de Mink et al., 2013;Schneider et al., 2014a) 
 and supernovae (Boubert et al., 2017b,a). Binary-star nucleosyn-thesis includes accretion and thermohaline mixing 
 (Stancliffe et al., 2007; Izzard et al.,2017) as well as explosions such as thermonuclear novae (Jos ÃÅe and Hernanz, 1998)
 and Ia supernovae (Claeys et al., 2014). 
 
 detailed stellar evolution code often crash when detailing with WD but synethetic code can handle them better.
