TERMINOLOGY:

Algol: a three star system



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
abstract

we cant model binaries well becuase they are so complex. we observe stars and deduce the parameters needed to build
simulations, then run them and see whats different. then we use this data to figure out any unknown physics
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
introduction
 
 some stars only form in binary systems, and some process require a secondary to happen i.e supernovae kilarnovae 
 
 some things that are uncertain in binary systems: mass transfer and loss, along with associated angular momentum redistribution
 
 stars take long time to simulate, population of stars even longer, and binary population really long-more stars and more parameters
 to deal with 
 
 triple star systems modelled like binary systems
