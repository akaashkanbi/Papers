TERMINOLOGY

periastron: point of closest approach for something orbiting a star

oscillation spectrum:?

stellar multiplicity: the number of stars

Tidal circularization: tidal forces that cause orbits to become less eccentric

Algols: systems where a secondary becomes more massive than the primary due to roche lobe overflow. can happen when the primary
expands out during RG phase.

entrain: incorporate and sweep along in its flow.

polars: WD + low mass companion. WD has strong magnetic field which accelerates the accretion stream straight onto the WD 
as opposed to a disk forming

contact binaries: when binary stars are so close to each other that they are in contact or their envelopes have merged to 
form a common envelope 

overcontact binary: common envelope formation within a binary


massive stars: >8 SM
intermediatary mass stars: 1.5-5 SM
low mass <0.5 SM
solar mass 0.7-1.3 SM

introduction

heatbeat stars: binary stars, but at the peristron, the one of the companions' ocillation spectrum is plucked
which allows us to know the stars structure below the photosphere

the likelihood of binaries interacting depend on mass loss rate and the action of tidal forces which change the oribital
separation

more massive stars are in binary systems than intermediatary and low mass stars

relatively few Solar-like binaries interact with their companions compared to more massive stars 
that are not only in binaries more often, but that have systematically closer companions.

equal mass binaries less common

mass ratio distribution: f(q)=q^gamma, where q=M2/m1, m1>m2---constitutent masses within the binary system

something not considered in binary codes are the effects of planetary masses on stellar evolution, could pollute the surface 
of the star, resulting in deviations in expected metallicity when comparing simulations to observation.
though no planets have been observed falling into a star, this doesnt suggest that it never happens.

Recent studies, e.g., Tokovinin & Kiyaeva (2016), suggest the number of stars, N, with a given eccentricity, e, is
dN/de=1.2e+0.4, at least for intermediate mass systems

a study was done on M35, found that no binaries and single stars were evenly distributed, suggests that formation of them 
doesnt require specific environments

younger stars are spherical and compact, but as they ge and expand, the companion distorts the evelope through gravity such
that youre left with something elliptical shaped, called eplisodial variables

roche lobe can shrink if the star loses angular momentum
any mass lying outside the roche lobe can flow onto the companion- robe lobe overflow
when the donor is in MS(core hydrogen burning), mass transfer is called type A
when donor is burning hydrogen in a shell, its called type B 
after helium ignition, type C 

conservative mass transfer: when no mass is lost during accretion
non conservative: mass is accreted, some is lost 

common envelope formation: one of the stars fills roche lobe, and then some
other star tries to accrete it, as it does, its roche lobe also fills up leading to common envelope formation
causes orbit to decay inwards

wind roche lobe overflow: wind from mass losing stars are given off and accreted unto the accretor, even in cases where the 
roche lobe is not filled 

detached binaries: binaries where neither roche lobe is filled
semi-detached binary: one has filled roche lobe , or they are in contact when roche lobe is filled
