TERMINOLOGY

periastron: point of closest approach for something orbiting a star

oscillation spectrum:?

stellar multiplicity: the number of stars

massive stars: >8 SM
intermediatary mass stars: 1.5-5 SM
low mass <0.5 SM
solar mass 0.7-1.3 SM

introduction

heatbeat stars: binary stars, but at the peristron, the one of the companions' ocillation spectrum is plucked
which allows us to know the stars structure below the photosphere

the likelihood of binaries interacting depend on mass loss rate and the action of tidal forces which change the oribital
separation

more massive stars are in binary systems than intermediatary and low mass stars
