TERMINOLOGY
helium star: O or B star with strong He lines,weak H lines because outer envelope has been stripped off by stellar winds from
the interior of the star

PIRS: post impact reminant star

subdwarf: star that is between the main sequence and white dward regions on HR diagrams

M-dwarf: M type main sequence star

shock: a disturbance that propagates faster than sound speed in the medium in question

subgiant: star that is brighter than the MS star (of same spectral class) but not as bright as giant stars 

SN1ax: supernovae via the HeWD channel (He accreted by a WD) either a helium double detonation explosion or CO He WD merger
SURVIVING WD-called a zombie star

Double detonations: when He is ignited in the He shell of the white dwarf, causing the supernova to occur before Chandra mass
has been reached- less luminous explosion link:

Delay-time-distribution (DTD): distribution of how long it takes for SN1a to occur since stellar birth

WHAT DOES THE PAPER ACCOMPLISH?
they found that helium rich stars expand out and increase in brightness, 10 years after the explosion

then they contract into a hot blue subdwarf like star before turning into a helium red giant

A helium companion star should therefore be seen 30 years after the SN explosion within the SN reminant, fast rotating,
high spactial velcity 

Introduction notes:

previous studies have been done on MS and sub giant stars- conclusion is that as energy is deposited into the companions
they will be hotter for some time BUT
they didnt do hydrodynamical simulations and so didnt properly calculate shock compression of stellar interior
or how far in the energy from the supernova was deposited into the companion star

What do hydrodynamical simulations achieve?
they take into account symmetry breaking effects of orbital motion, rotation of the star, and RLOF which can complicate 
how the explosion happens

by taking these into account, pan et al corrected the previous studies and found that MS companions subgiants with higher
luminosity with slow rotation BUT they predicted tycho G to be twice as bright as it is.
