abstract--specific, no worthless generality like "differences between such and such are analysed and discussed". what are the differences?
should be very dense with content, no citations or references to other shit as its likely that the abstract will be seen by itself on a website 
--main objectives
--methods used and summary of results
--what was concluded from this

introduction--say the common ground, break it with contradiction/hole in the literature leaving the reader ancipating a response. this leads to papers purpose
--dont start intro with a very obvious statement like "tornados cause death and distruction.." unless you will prove the statement is false
--what the paper will and will not address is also important in the introduction
--personal motivation for writing might also be nice to include here 
--last paragraph of intro should summarise the papers structure 

background/literature synethesis section- like a textbook for the reader. analyse the stuff we know, are they true? are they false? why?
look at table 4.5 on page 38 for a check list of things you need to consider
--could be part of the introduction or you could have your own sections addressing this 

you can discuss background/literature synethesis stuff in other sections, say some piece of knowledge is important in section 6, talking about it at the 
start might not be the best way going about this
